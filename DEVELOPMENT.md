# Development Guide

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can develop or run the AI Language Learning application, you need to install and configure the following tools and services:

**Note**: The setup script (`./setup.sh`) will automatically handle most of the dependency installation and environment setup once these core tools are installed.

### üê≥ Core Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Version 20.10+ for containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.0+ for multi-container orchestration

### üêç Python Environment
- **Python**: Version 3.11+ (required for FastAPI and modern Python features)
- **uv**: Modern Python package manager and project tool
- **pyenv** (recommended): For Python version management

### üü¢ Node.js Environment
- **nvm**: Node Version Manager for Node.js version control
- **Node.js**: Version 18.20.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools
- **just**: Command runner for task automation
- **Git**: Version control system

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Services (Optional for Development)
- **Google Cloud Platform**: For AI/ML services in production
- **OpenAI API**: For advanced language processing features

## üöÄ Installation Guide

### 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install --cask docker

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose

# Windows
# Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
```

**Note**: Docker is required for both modes - even in local development mode, the database services (PostgreSQL and Redis) run in Docker containers for consistency and ease of setup.

### 2. Install Python 3.11+
```bash
# Using pyenv (recommended)
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

pyenv install 3.11.7
pyenv global 3.11.7

# Verify installation
python --version  # Should show Python 3.11.7
```

### 3. Install uv
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Verify installation
uv --version
```

### 4. Install nvm and Node.js
```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Restart terminal or source profile
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc

# Install Node.js version from .nvmrc
nvm install 18.20.0
nvm use 18.20.0

# Verify installation
node --version  # Should show v18.20.0
npm --version
```

### 5. Install just
```bash
# macOS
brew install just

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin

# Windows
# Download from https://github.com/casey/just/releases

# Verify installation
just --version
```

### 6. Install Pre-commit Hooks (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit in the backend virtual environment
cd backend && uv pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Go back to root directory
cd ..
```

**Note**: Pre-commit hooks automatically run `just quality` before each commit, ensuring code quality is maintained.

### 7. Verify All Prerequisites
```bash
# Run the setup script to verify everything is working
./setup.sh

# Or check manually
just check-prerequisites
```

## üîß Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd language-learning
```

### 2. Initial Setup (Required Once)
The setup script (`./setup.sh`) handles the initial environment setup and must be run at least once:

- **Python Dependencies**: Installs all Python packages using `uv`
- **Node.js Dependencies**: Installs all npm packages
- **Database Setup**: Creates database initialization scripts
- **Nginx Configuration**: Sets up nginx configuration files
- **Environment Verification**: Checks all prerequisites are met

```bash
# Make setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run setup script
./setup.sh
```

**Note**: After the initial setup, you can use `just` commands for day-to-day development without running the setup script again.

### 3. Prerequisite Verification (Optional but Recommended)
Use `just check-prerequisites` to verify your environment is ready for development:

```bash
# Check all prerequisites
just check-prerequisites
```

This command verifies:
- Docker and Docker Compose are available
- Python 3.11+ is installed
- nvm and Node.js are properly configured
- uv package manager is available
- just command runner is available

### 4. Choose Your Development Mode

#### **Option A: Docker Mode (Production-like, Easy Setup)**
```bash
# Make setup script executable (if not already)
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run setup - this will start everything in Docker
./setup.sh
```

**Best for**: New developers, demos, production testing, team onboarding

#### **Option B: Local Development Mode (Fast Iteration)**
```bash
# Verify prerequisites are met
just check-prerequisites

# Start only database services in Docker
just db-start

# Start local development servers
just dev
```

**Best for**: Active development, debugging, fast iteration, IDE integration

**Note**: The setup script (`./setup.sh`) must be run at least once to install Python and Node.js dependencies. After that, use `just check-prerequisites` to verify your environment is ready for local development.



### 5. Hybrid Setup (Selective Containerization)
```bash
# Verify prerequisites are met
just check-prerequisites

# Start database services
just db-start

# Choose which services to run locally vs. in Docker
# Backend in Docker (production-like)
docker-compose up -d backend

# Frontend locally (fast development)
just dev-frontend
```

**Best for**: Testing specific services in production-like conditions while keeping others local

**Note**: Use `just dev-frontend` instead of manually running `npm start` to ensure consistency with the project's command structure.

## ‚úÖ Verification

After running the setup script, verify everything is working:

### **Docker Mode Verification**
```bash
# Check all services
just health

# Run tests
just test

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### **Local Development Mode Verification**
```bash
# Check database services
just verify-db-health

# Check backend (should be running on port 8000)
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check frontend (should be running on port 3000)
curl http://localhost:3000

# Run tests
just test
```

**Note**: In local development mode, the frontend runs on port 3000 (not served by nginx), and the backend runs with hot reloading enabled.

**Important**: The setup script must be run at least once before using local development mode to install all dependencies. Use `just check-prerequisites` to verify your environment is ready.

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8000  # Backend port
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend port
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL port
lsof -i :6379  # Redis port

# Kill conflicting processes if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### **Service Not Starting**
```bash
# Check service status
just status

# View logs
just logs

# Restart services
just restart
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Prerequisites

### Docker Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop or Docker service
- **Permission denied**: Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 8000, 3000, 5432, 6379 are available

### Python Issues
- **Wrong Python version**: The setup script automatically handles Python version management with `uv`
- **uv not found**: Ensure uv is in your PATH
- **Virtual environment issues**: The setup script automatically creates and manages virtual environments

### Node.js Issues
- **Wrong Node.js version**: The setup script automatically uses the correct Node.js version from `.nvmrc`
- **nvm not found**: Source your profile file: `source ~/.bashrc`
- **npm install fails**: The setup script handles npm installation automatically

### just Issues
- **Command not found**: Ensure just is in your PATH
- **Permission denied**: Check file permissions and ownership

## üîÑ Updating Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify prerequisites (optional, but recommended)
just check-prerequisites

# Start everything for development
just start

# Stop everything when done
just stop

# Or use development commands
just dev
just dev-stop
```

**Note**: After the initial setup, you only need to use `just` commands for day-to-day development. The setup script handles dependency installation, database setup, and environment configuration.

### 2. **Choosing Your Development Mode**

#### **Start with Docker Mode if:**
- üÜï **New to the project** - Get up and running quickly
- üß™ **Testing integration** - Verify all services work together
- üéØ **Demo purposes** - Show the complete application
- üîÑ **CI/CD validation** - Test Docker builds and deployment
- üë• **Team collaboration** - Ensure consistent environment

#### **Switch to Local Mode when:**
- ‚ö° **Active development** - Making frequent code changes
- üêõ **Debugging issues** - Need to inspect variables and set breakpoints
- üõ†Ô∏è **IDE integration** - Want full autocomplete and refactoring support
- üî• **Hot reloading** - Need immediate feedback on code changes
- üíª **Resource constraints** - Running on lower-end machines

#### **Use Hybrid Mode for:**
- üé≠ **Selective testing** - Test specific services in production-like conditions
- üöÄ **Performance testing** - Test backend performance while keeping frontend fast
- üîß **Service debugging** - Debug one service locally while others run in containers

## üê≥ Two Ways to Run the Application

The AI Language Learning application can be run in two different modes, each with its own advantages and use cases:

### 1. **Docker Mode (Production-like Environment)**
```bash
# Start all services in Docker containers
just start

# Or use the setup script
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Runs PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend, and Frontend in Docker containers
- Uses production Docker images with nginx serving the frontend
- Backend runs with uvicorn in production mode
- All services are containerized and isolated

**When to use Docker mode:**
- ‚úÖ **Testing production-like environment** - Mimics how the app will run in production
- ‚úÖ **Full-stack integration testing** - Test the complete system end-to-end
- ‚úÖ **Demo purposes** - Show stakeholders the complete application
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD testing** - Verify Docker builds and container orchestration
- ‚úÖ **Team onboarding** - New developers can run the app without local setup
- ‚úÖ **Database persistence** - Data persists between restarts
- ‚úÖ **Consistent environment** - Same behavior across different machines

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **Slower development cycle** - Need to rebuild containers for code changes
- ‚ùå **Resource intensive** - Uses more memory and CPU
- ‚ùå **Less debugging** - Harder to attach debuggers or inspect running processes
- ‚ùå **Hot reload limited** - Backend has basic reload, frontend requires container rebuild

### 2. **Local Development Mode (Fast Iteration)**
```bash
# Start only database services in Docker
just db-start

# Start backend development server locally
just dev-backend

# Start frontend development server locally  
just dev-frontend

# Or start both together
just dev
```

**What this does:**
- Database services (PostgreSQL, Redis) run in Docker containers
- Backend runs locally with `uvicorn --reload` for hot reloading
- Frontend runs locally with `npm start` for hot reloading
- Your local code changes are immediately reflected

**When to use Local mode:**
- ‚úÖ **Fast development iteration** - Code changes are reflected immediately
- ‚úÖ **Debugging** - Easy to attach debuggers, set breakpoints, inspect variables
- ‚úÖ **IDE integration** - Full IDE support for autocomplete, refactoring, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Resource efficient** - Uses less memory and CPU
- ‚úÖ **Hot reloading** - Both frontend and backend reload automatically
- ‚úÖ **Local file access** - Easy to access local files, environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Development tools** - Full access to development tools and extensions

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **Local setup required** - Need Python, Node.js, and dependencies installed
- ‚ùå **Environment differences** - May behave differently than production
- ‚ùå **Port conflicts** - Need to ensure ports 8000, 3000, 5432, 6379 are available
- ‚ùå **Dependency management** - Need to manage Python and Node.js versions locally

### 3. **Hybrid Mode (Best of Both Worlds)**
```bash
# Start database services
just db-start

# Start backend in Docker (for production-like testing)
docker-compose up -d backend

# Start frontend locally (for fast UI development)
just dev-frontend
```

**When to use Hybrid mode:**
- ‚úÖ **Backend production testing** - Test backend in production-like environment
- ‚úÖ **Frontend fast iteration** - Quick UI/UX development and testing
- ‚úÖ **Selective containerization** - Choose which services to containerize
- ‚úÖ **Performance testing** - Test backend performance in production-like conditions

## üîÑ Switching Between Modes

just stop

# Start only database services
just db-start

# Start local development servers
just dev
```

### From Local to Docker Mode
```bash
# Stop local development servers
just dev-stop

# Start all Docker services
just start
```

### Clean Slate
```bash
# Stop everything and clean up
just stop
docker-compose down -v

# Start fresh (choose your mode)
just start    # Docker mode
# OR
just dev      # Local mode
```

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd language-learning

# Run setup script (recommended)

## üìã Summary: Development Workflow

### **Initial Setup (One-time)**
1. Install core prerequisites (Docker, uv, nvm, just)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `./setup.sh` to install dependencies and configure environment

### **Daily Development**
- **Prerequisite Check**: `just check-prerequisites` (verify environment)
- **Docker Mode**: `just start-docker` (production-like environment)
- **Local Mode**: `just start` (fast iteration with hot reloading)
- **Database Management**: `just db-start`, `just db-seed`
- **Testing**: `just test`, `just quality`
- **Service Management**: `just status`, `just logs`

### **Key Points**
- The setup script handles dependency installation automatically
- Use `just` commands for day-to-day development
- Choose between Docker and Local modes based on your needs
- Database services always run in Docker for consistency
