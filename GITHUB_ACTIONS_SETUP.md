# GitHub Actions Setup Summary

## What Was Created

I've set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically run tests and quality checks when code is pushed to your repository.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/test-and-quality.yml`
**Main workflow** that runs the equivalent of your `just test` and `just quality` commands.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

**What it does:**
- Sets up Python 3.11 and Node.js 20.0.0
- Installs `uv` for Python dependency management
- Installs `just` command runner
- Sets up PostgreSQL and Redis services for testing
- Installs backend and frontend dependencies
- Runs `just test` (backend + frontend tests)
- Runs `just quality` (formatting, linting, type checking)

### 2. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Comprehensive CI pipeline** with separate jobs for different concerns.

**Jobs:**
- Backend Tests (with coverage)
- Frontend Tests (with coverage)
- Backend Quality Checks
- Frontend Quality Checks
- Integration Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Test Results Summary

### 3. `.github/README.md`
Documentation explaining how the workflows work and how to use them.

### 4. `.github/workflows/badges.yml`
Placeholder workflow for generating status badges (can be customized later).

## How It Works

1. **When you push code** to `main` or `develop` branches, GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. **The workflow** sets up a clean environment with Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis
3. **Dependencies are installed** using your existing `pyproject.toml` and `package-lock.json`
4. **Tests run** using your existing `just test` command
5. **Quality checks run** using your existing `just quality` command
6. **Results are reported** in the GitHub Actions tab

## What This Gives You

✅ **Automated Testing**: No more forgetting to run tests before pushing  
✅ **Quality Assurance**: Code formatting, linting, and type checking are enforced  
✅ **Early Bug Detection**: Issues are caught before they reach production  
✅ **Consistent Environment**: Tests run in the same environment every time  
✅ **Database Testing**: Full PostgreSQL and Redis services available for testing  
✅ **Coverage Reports**: Test coverage is tracked and reported  

## Local Testing

Before pushing, you can test the same commands that run in CI:

```bash
# Run tests
just test

# Run quality checks
just quality

# Or both together
just test && just quality
```

## Next Steps

1. **Push this code** to trigger your first GitHub Actions run
2. **Check the Actions tab** in GitHub to see the workflow in action
3. **Review the results** to ensure everything is working
4. **Customize as needed** - you can modify the workflows to add more checks

## Customization Options

You can easily extend the workflows to:
- Add more quality checks
- Run performance tests
- Generate deployment artifacts
- Send notifications on failures
- Add security scanning
- Run dependency vulnerability checks

## Troubleshooting

If the workflows fail:
1. Check that `just test` and `just quality` work locally
2. Verify all dependencies are properly specified
3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
4. Ensure your database models and tests are compatible with the CI environment

## Benefits

- **Confidence**: Know your code works before merging
- **Quality**: Maintain consistent code standards
- **Collaboration**: Team members can see test results
- **Documentation**: Workflows serve as living documentation of your process
- **Automation**: Focus on coding, not manual testing

The setup is designed to be lightweight but comprehensive, running your existing commands in a controlled environment to ensure consistency and reliability.
