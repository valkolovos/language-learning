# Code Standards

## Architecture
- Clean, predictable data models
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Type safety with TypeScript
- **Web-based UI** that supports all screen sizes
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and proper type hints
- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React 18 with strict mode and modern patterns
- **Development**: Use `just` commands for all development tasks (build, test, lint, etc.)

## React Patterns
- Modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Proper state management for UI states
- Component composition over inheritance
- Accessibility-first component design

## Error Handling
- Structured error representation for malformed content
- Graceful error handling without crashing the app
- User-friendly error messages with retry options
- App remains usable even when content fails to load

## Code Quality
- All code must be covered with tests
- Requirements must be covered with Gherkin BDD tests
- Code must adhere to formatting and linting rules in the repository
- Run `just quality` before commits (pre-commit hooks configured)
