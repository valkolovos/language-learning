# Core Product Principles

This is an MVP for a listen-first language learning platform focused on achieving 'can-do' moments in ≤5 minutes.

## Key Principles
- **Audio-first, phrase-first, intelligibility-focused learning**
- **Tiny loops (30-60 seconds)** with immediate measurable wins
- **Local-first operation** (no sign-in or cloud dependencies for MVP)
- **Listen-first gate**: text hidden until main line played twice completely
- **Focus on conversational phrases** over exhaustive grammar

## MVP Scope - Single Micro-Lesson 'Meet & Greet'
- One main line + three supporting phrases
- Audio playback with reveal gate after 2 complete plays
- Phrase replay functionality after text reveal
- Lightweight progress signals and XP (visual only)
- Basic analytics and accessibility (Lighthouse a11y ≥90)
