# Event Instrumentation (Lightweight)

## Required Events
- `lesson_started { lesson_code }`
- `audio_play { lesson_code, clip_id }`
- `text_revealed { lesson_code }`
- `phrase_replay { lesson_code, phrase_id }`

## Implementation
- Events stored locally (no external services for MVP)
- Simple, inspectable form (buffered in memory or logged)
- No cloud dependencies or server round-trips
- Focus on funnel analysis: start → first play → second play → reveal → phrase replay
