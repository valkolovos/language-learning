## Quality & Testing
- **BDD tests**: pytest-bdd for critical user flows and requirements coverage
- **Unit tests**: Reveal gate logic (exactly 2 plays unlock)
- **Interaction tests**: Pre/post-reveal behaviors
- **E2E tests**: Critical journeys with stable selectors
- **Performance**: Keep time-to-first-audio low
