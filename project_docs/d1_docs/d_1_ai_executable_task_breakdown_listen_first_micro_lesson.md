### ðŸŽ‰ **DELIVERABLE COMPLETE**
All 24 tasks have been implemented successfully. The Listen-First language learning platform is ready for use and testing.

**Scope assumptions**
- Lesson pattern: one **main line** (a short greeting) and **three supporting phrases**.
- **Listenâ€‘first gate**: written text remains hidden **until the main line has been fully played at least twice**. Partial or failed plays don't count.
- Local playback only; no accounts or server roundâ€‘trips required.

---

## Track A â€” Content & Data (what must exist, not how)

**A1. Content representation** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Provide a representation for a lesson containing: a main line, three phrases, each with native text, a learnerâ€‘friendly gloss/translation, optional tips, and a reference to an audio clip.
- **Acceptance:** The lesson can be loaded at runtime; fields are available to the UI; malformed content is handled gracefully (error surfaced, app still usable).
- **Status:** Lesson data structure implemented with proper validation and error handling in `LessonService`.

**A2. Audio association** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Establish a way to associate each line/phrase with a playable audio source.
- **Acceptance:** Each content item resolves to a playable clip; naming/IDs are consistent; guidance exists for audio normalization (volume and loudness) and clip length (â‰¤ ~2.5s per item).
- **Status:** Audio clips properly associated with TTS support, consistent ID system, and volume/language configuration.

---

## Track B â€” Playback & Gating Logic

**B1. Singleâ€‘stream audio playback** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Provide a playback capability that plays one audio clip at a time and exposes start/end/error signals.
- **Acceptance:** Starting a new clip stops the previous one; listeners are cleaned up; errors are surfaced in the UI.
- **Status:** `AudioPlaybackService` implements single-stream playback with proper event handling and error management.

**B2. Reveal gate** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Implement logic that unlocks text **only after two complete plays** of the main line.
- **Acceptance:** Incomplete/errored/aborted plays do not increment; a computed `can reveal?` state becomes true only after two verified completions.
- **Status:** Gate logic implemented in `AudioPlaybackService` with play counting and `canReveal` state management.

**B3. Event instrumentation (lightweight)** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Capture a minimal set of usage events for later inspection.
- **Events:** `lesson_started`, `audio_play` (with clip identifier), `text_revealed`, `phrase_replay` (with phrase identifier).
- **Status:** `EventTrackingService` implemented with all required event types, and `phrase_replay` events are now triggered when users replay individual phrases.

---

## Track C â€” User Experience (behaviors, not components)

**C1. Lesson container** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Present a minimal interface with: a hint to listen first, a primary Play control for the main line, and no visible text before the gate unlocks.
- **Acceptance:** On lesson open, `lesson_started` is recorded; preâ€‘reveal, only listening controls and hint are visible.
- **Status:** `LessonContainer` component implemented with listen-first UI and proper event tracking.

**C2. Main Play control** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Allow the learner to play/replay the main line, with clear visual feedback for idle/playing/completed.
- **Acceptance:** After exactly two full plays, the gate state becomes unlocked and a reveal action becomes available.
- **Status:** `AudioPlayer` component with play/stop controls, visual feedback, and progress tracking.

**C3. Reveal interaction** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** When the gate is unlocked, provide a clear action to reveal the text and the rest of the lesson.
- **Acceptance:** On reveal, show the full main line text, phrase items, a **Replay all** action, and a **Transcript** toggle; record `text_revealed` once.
- **Status:** Reveal button implemented with **Replay all** action and **Transcript** toggle functionality. All post-reveal controls are now available.

**C4. Phrase replays** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Allow tapping/clicking each phrase to hear its audio with visible playing state and accessible feedback.
- **Acceptance:** Rapid replays are handled; only one clip plays at a time; `phrase_replay` is recorded with the associated phrase.
- **Status:** `PhrasePlayer` component implemented with individual phrase audio controls, visual playing state feedback, and proper event tracking.

**C5. Transcript toggle** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Provide a control to show/hide the learner gloss/translation after reveal.
- **Acceptance:** Transcript is not available preâ€‘reveal; after reveal it can be toggled without layout jumps or loss of focus.
- **Status:** `TranscriptToggle` component implemented with show/hide functionality for gloss text. Toggle works smoothly without layout disruption.

**C6. Progress indicator & XP (optional, visual only)** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Provide a lightweight visual indicator of progress and an XP counter that increments on key actions.
- **Acceptance:** Indicator reaches 100% once text is revealed; counters are local, nonâ€‘persistent, and never block usage.
- **Status:** `ProgressIndicator` component implemented with XP counter and progress percentage. XP awarded for reveal (50), phrase replays (10 each), and replay all (25).

## Track D â€” Accessibility & Resilience âœ… **COMPLETED**

**D1. Keyboard & focus** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Ensure every interactive control is operable using keyboard alone, with logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
- **Acceptance:** Tab navigation works through all controls; Enter/Space activate controls; focus is clearly visible; default browser behavior is prevented.
- **Status:** Full keyboard navigation implemented with logical tab order, Enter/Space key support, and visible focus indicators. Accessibility feature tests implemented and passing.

**D2. Screen reader affordances** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Provide clear announcements for state changes, playback events, and progress updates using ARIA live regions.
- **Acceptance:** Screen readers announce when text becomes available, when content is revealed, and during audio playback changes.
- **Status:** ARIA live regions implemented with announcements for gate unlocking, text reveal, and playback state changes. Accessibility feature tests implemented and passing.

**D3. Error states & recovery** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Handle audio failures gracefully with clear error messages and retry options that maintain accessibility.
- **Acceptance:** Error messages are screen reader accessible; retry button is clearly labeled and focusable; focus management during recovery is appropriate.
- **Status:** Error handling implemented with accessible error messages and retry functionality. Accessibility feature tests implemented and passing.

**D4. Accessibility feature tests** âœ… **COMPLETED** ðŸ†•
- **Goal:** Implement comprehensive Cucumber tests for all accessibility features to ensure WCAG compliance.
- **Acceptance:** All accessibility scenarios pass, covering keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support, and ARIA compliance.
- **Status:** Complete accessibility test suite implemented with 10 scenarios covering keyboard operability, tab navigation, focus management, screen reader announcements, ARIA labels, and error state accessibility. All tests passing.

- **Acceptance:** Automated checks confirm state transitions and visibility rules.
- **Status:** Tests validate state transitions, visibility rules, and component behavior.

**E3. Endâ€‘toâ€‘end checks** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Goal:** Validate critical journeys: (1) two plays â†’ reveal available; (2) reveal â†’ phrase replays show playing state; (3) simulate audio error â†’ retry works and gate remains locked.
- **Acceptance:** Checks use stable selectors not tied to userâ€‘visible copy.
- **Status:** End-to-end tests implemented with stable selectors and proper test coverage.

**E4. Performance sanity** âœ… **COMPLETED**

## Suggested Implementation Order (fastest proofâ€‘ofâ€‘value)
1) A1 â†’ C1 (content is loadable; lesson opens with listenâ€‘first UI)
2) B1/B2 â†’ C2 (playback works; gate unlocks at 2 full plays)
3) C3/C4/C5 (reveal + phrase replays + transcript)
4) D1/D2/D3 (accessibility + error handling) âœ… **COMPLETED**
5) C6 (optional progress/XP)
6) E1â€“E4 (quality checks)
7) F1â€“F3 (copy & handoff docs)

## Outâ€‘ofâ€‘Scope Guardrails
- No speech recording, scoring, accounts, or external servers.
- Keep audio local and short; avoid cloud media dependencies.
- Progress/XP are visual only; no persistence required.
